// SparkFun DataLogger IoT – 9DoF Test Example
// Tested with Espressif ESP32 v2.0.5 and the "ESP32 Dev Module" board definition

/**********************************************************************************************
 *
 * WARNING!
 * 
 * This is a sketch we wrote to test the DataLogger IoT – 9DoF hardware.
 * Please think very carefully before uploading it to your DataLogger.
 * 
 * You will overwrite the DataLogger firmware, leaving it unable to update or restore itself. 
 * 
 * The DataLogger IoT – 9DoF comes pre-programmed with amazing firmware which can do _so_ much.
 * It is designed to be able to update itself and restore itself if necessary.
 * But it can not do that if you overwrite the firmware with this test sketch.
 * It is just like erasing the restore partition on your computer hard drive.
 * Do not do it - unless you really know what you are doing.
 * 
 * Really. We mean it.
 * 
 * Your friends at SparkFun.
